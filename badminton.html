  <h1>HOW TO PLAY BADMINTON？</h1>
<div class="badmintonconticerik">
  <div class="kutu">
 <h3>Scoring System</h3>
      <ul>
     <li>A match consists of the best of 3 games of 21 points.</li>
     <li>Every time there is a serve – there is a point scored.</li>
     <li>The side winning a rally adds a point to its score.</li>
     <li>At 20 all, the side which gains a 2 point lead first, wins that game.</li>
     <li>At 29 all, the side scoring the 30th point, wins that game.</li>
     <li>The side winning a game serves first in the next game.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="kutu">
    <h3>Interval and Change of Ends</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When the leading score reaches 11 points, players have a 60 second interval.</li>
        <li>A 2 minute interval between each game is allowed.</li>
        <li>In the third game, players change ends when the leading score reaches 11 points.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="kutu">
    <h3>Singles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>At the beginning of the game (0-0) and when the server’s score is even, the server serves from the right service court. When the server’s score is odd, the server serves from the left service court.</li>
    <li>If the server wins a rally, the server scores a point and then serves again from the alternate service court.</li>
    <li>If the receiver wins a rally, the receiver scores a point and becomes the new server. They serve from the appropriate service court – left if their score is odd, and right if it is even.</li>
  </ul>

        <h3>Doubles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A side has only one ‘service’.</li>
    <li>The service passes consecutively to the players as shown in the diagram.</li>
    <li>At the beginning of the game and when the score is even, the server serves from the right service court. When it is odd, the server serves from the left court.</li>
    <li>If the serving side wins a rally, the serving side scores a point and the same server serves again from the alternate service court.</li>
    <li>If the receiving side wins a rally, the receiving side scores a point. The receiving side becomes the new serving side.</li>
    <li>The players do not change their respective service courts until they win a point when their side is serving.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>If players commit an error in the service court, the error is corrected when the mistake is discovered.</li>
    <li>In a doubles match between A &amp; B against C &amp; D. A &amp; B won the toss and decided to serve. A to serve to C. A shall be the initial server while C shall be the initial receiver.</li>
