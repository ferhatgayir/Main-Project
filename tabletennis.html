<h1>Official Table Tennis Rules - Explained</h1>

    <section>
  <p>Table tennis can be played with either one player on each side - <strong>Singles Match</strong> or two players on each side - <strong>Doubles Match</strong>. While the singles matches are more popular, the real fun is in doubles. Broadly the rules for singles and doubles are the same.</p>

  <p>In the next section, we'll be discussing the rules for each of them.</p>

  <h3>Meaning of the various commonly used terms:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rally</strong> - Simply put, a rally starts the moment server performs the service and ends as soon any of the players wins a point.</li>
    <li><strong>Let</strong> - The rally, which does not result in a point, is known as a let.</li>
    <li><strong>Fault</strong> - Failure of the server to do a legal serve.</li>
    <li><strong>Re-serve</strong> - When an otherwise legal serve touches the net. The server needs to serve the ball again.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>How does the game start?</h3>
   

  <p>The game starts with first deciding who serves first and from which end.</p>

  <h4>Competitive Level</h4>
  <p>As per the official ITTF rule (2.13.1), the game starts with the toss of the coin with two distinct sides.</p>

  <h4>Recreational Level</h4>
  <p>
    Players play a rally, and whoever wins gets to decide who starts. Another common way is hiding the ball in one of the hands,
    keeping both hands under the table, and asking the opponent to guess.
  </p>

  <p>The winner can either choose to serve first or choose the side.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the winner chooses to serve first, then the opponent has the option to select the end.</li>
    <li>If the winner chooses the end, the opponent has the option to decide who serves first.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Serving Rules in Singles and Doubles</h3>

  <h4>Singles Match</h4>
  <p>
    A valid serve should be such that it <strong>bounces once on the server's court</strong> and 
    at least <strong>once on the receiver's court</strong> without touching the net. 
    There is <strong>no restriction</strong> on where the ball may bounce on either side.
  </p>

  <h4>Doubles Match</h4>
  <p>
    The serve should be done <strong>diagonally</strong> from the <strong>right half court of the server</strong> 
    to the <strong>right half court of the receiver</strong> such that the ball 
    bounces successfully on each court <strong>without touching the net</strong>.
  </p>

  <section>
  <h3>Serving and the Net</h3>

  <p>If the ball hits the net while serving, there are two possible outcomes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>If the ball touches the net and falls on the opposite side</strong>, then the server needs to serve again. 
      This is often referred to as <strong>'RE'</strong> or <strong>'Re-serve'</strong>. 
      <br>No point is lost or gained.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>There is no limit</strong> on how many re-serves a player can do.
      <br><em>Contrary to popular belief</em>, the idea that two consecutive net touches cause a point loss is <strong>wrong</strong>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>If the ball hits the net and remains on the server's side</strong>, then the server <strong>loses the point</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to Serve</h3>

  <p>For a serve to be considered <strong>legal</strong>, the server must follow these rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The server should start by <strong>placing the ball on their open palm</strong>, 
      completely <strong>visible to the opponent</strong>.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      While serving, the server should be <strong>behind the end line of the table</strong>.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      The server must <strong>throw the ball at least 16 cm</strong> above the table level, 
      <strong>without applying any spin</strong> on the ball.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      The server should <strong>strike the ball with the paddle during its fall</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is a Valid Return?</h3>

  <p>
    The receiver must <strong>hit the ball with their paddle</strong> (whether during a serve or rally)
    <strong>after the ball has bounced once on their side</strong>, such that:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The ball <strong>clears the net</strong> and lands on the opponent’s court, or
    </li>
    <li>
      The ball <strong>touches the net</strong> and still <strong>lands on the opponent’s court</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is a Let?</h3>

  <p>
    When a serve or return <strong>results in no point</strong>, it is called a <strong>Let</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>During serve:</strong> If the ball <strong>bounces once on the server's side</strong>, 
      then <strong>touches the net</strong> and lands on the receiver’s side, 
      the serve must be repeated. <br>
      <em>No point is lost or gained</em>, and there is <strong>no limit</strong> on the number of re-serves allowed.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>During play:</strong> If there is an <strong>external disturbance</strong> (like a ball falling from another court), 
      the point is replayed.
    </li>

    <li>
      If the <strong>receiver is not ready</strong> at the time of the serve, the service is replayed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>When is the Point Scored or Lost?</h3>

  <p>A point is <strong>won</strong> or <strong>lost</strong> under the following conditions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Illegal serve:</strong> If the server performs an illegal serve 
      (e.g., the ball does not clear the net), the <strong>receiver gains a point</strong>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Failed return:</strong> If the receiver or the server fails to return the ball legally, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>The ball hits the net and remains on their own side</li>
        <li>The ball goes out of the table without bouncing on the opponent's side</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Physical interference:</strong> A player <strong>moves the table</strong>, 
      <strong>touches the table with their free (non-playing) hand</strong>, or 
      <strong>touches the net</strong> during play.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Double-hit:</strong> If a player intentionally <strong>double-hits the ball</strong>, 
      they lose the point. <br>
      However, if the ball <strong>touches the playing hand above the wrist</strong> during play, 
      it is <em>legal</em> and <strong>does not result in a point loss</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scoring System</h3>

  <p>
    A table tennis match is played in a <strong>"best of 3, 5 or 7"</strong> format. 
    Most international tournaments use the <strong>best of 7 games</strong> system. 
    The player who wins the majority of games (e.g., <strong>4-3</strong>, <strong>4-0</strong>) wins the match.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each game is played up to <strong>11 points</strong>, with each player getting 
    <strong>two consecutive serves</strong> before switching.
  </p>

  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <p>
    Let's say Player A wins the toss and decides to serve. He wins one point and then loses the next — scores are now <strong>1-1</strong>.  
    Now, <strong>Player B</strong> will serve two times in a row. The match continues in this alternating manner.
  </p>

  <p>
    The winner of the game is the <strong>first to reach 11 points</strong>, 
    <strong>with at least a 2-point lead</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>Deuce</h4>
  <p>
    A <strong>deuce</strong> occurs when the score is <strong>10-10</strong>. At this point:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Each player serves <strong>one time</strong> before switching again.</li>
    <li>The player who gains a <strong>2-point lead</strong> wins the game.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Deuce Example:</h4>
  <p>
    Player A is at 9 points, and Player B is at 10. Player A serves and wins the point — now the score is <strong>10-10</strong> (Deuce).
  </p>

  <p>
    Now:
    <ul>
      <li>Player B serves once. If he wins the point, score becomes <strong>11-10</strong>.</li>
      <li>Player A then serves once. If he wins, score becomes <strong>11-11</strong>.</li>
      <li>This continues until one player leads by 2 points (e.g., <strong>13-11</strong>, <strong>15-13</strong> etc.).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    After the match is complete, the players <strong>switch sides</strong>.

  <h3>Table Tennis Doubles Rules</h3>

  <p>
    The primary rules of the game remain the same as in singles, 
    but there are a few key <strong>differences in the flow</strong> of the match.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Differences in Doubles:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Like singles, each game is played up to <strong>11 points</strong>, and each server gets 
      <strong>two consecutive serves</strong>.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <strong>serve must be diagonal</strong>, from the server's <strong>right half court</strong> to the receiver's 
      <strong>right half court</strong>, and must bounce once on each side.
    </li>

    <li>
      After a successful serve:
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>receiver</strong> must return the ball.</li>
        <li>Then the <strong>server's partner</strong> returns the ball.</li>
        <li>Then the <strong>receiver’s partner</strong> returns it.</li>
        <li>This rotation continues throughout the rally.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Note:</strong> After the serve, the ball can be returned <strong>anywhere</strong> on the opponent’s court — it 
      <strong>does not need to be diagonal</strong> like the serve.
    </li>

    <li>
      After each <strong>service change</strong> (i.e., after 2 serves):
      <ul>
        <li>The previous <strong>server switches places with their partner</strong>.</li>
        <li>The previous <strong>receiver becomes the new server</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
